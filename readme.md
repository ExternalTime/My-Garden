# My digital garden

Welcome to my digital garden. While I'm not completely sure this counts as one,
I don't know what else to call it so that's what I'll stick to for now.

This is a place for me to put things I write, which is mostly going to be
educational content on programming. Dates shouldn't matter I'll edit things if
I figure out how to improve them. I don't want to constrain myself to formal
language, but knowing myself most of it will tend towards it anyway.

For now I'm posting it simply as a collection of markdown files, because it
works well enough for now and I know I'll obsess over *everything* if I try to
make it into actuall website.
