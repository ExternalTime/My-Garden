# My writings

This is a space for the things I write (mostly educational stuff on
programming). This is specifically *not* a blog. These posts should be
evergreen, some things I'll post unfinished and I'll reword / rewrite stuff if I
figure out how to explain it better.

For now I'm posting it simply as a collection of markdown files, because it
works well enough for now and I know I'll obsess over *everything* if I try to
make it into actuall website.
